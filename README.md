#Control Elfin robot arm with python code over TCP/IP Communication #Gripper 2F-140

This is a python library using the commands of the "Hansrobot protocol interface" to provide hooks for HansRobot Elfin robot arm on Windows, Mac or Linux.

## Features:
1. Block-based coding is no longer necessary, eliminating the need for a compilation process.
2. The program has been tested on various platforms, including PC, Jetson Nano, and Raspberry Pi.
3. Expanded applicability: The robotic arm can now operate with sensors on both Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano.
4. Smooth operation is ensured as the time.delay command is not used.
5. Enhanced flexibility: Such as users can adjust the speed at any point during operation.
6. Simultaneous control of two or more robotic arms.

## Usage : Take the app.py as an example
1. Connect the robot arm and Raspberry Pi to same private network.
2. Make sure the IP address of the robot arm is entered in app.py
3. Run the app.py
